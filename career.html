<h3> Career 101: Why Responding to ‘Negative’ Emails is Crucial</h3>
<p> <pAn email response from the human resource department to your earlier application reads, in part, “Thank you for your interest in IT Management position at TG Communications Ltd-not a real company. We owe our applicants adequate and professional communication regarding their effort in search of these limited job opportunities and we appreciate your endeavor.</p> <p> However, we regret that your application DIDN’T make it to the next stage of this process. We’ve recognized your skills, knowledge and work experience and we hope to consider you for related future opportunities.

We have your contacts on the resume and are willing to engage you should any position become vacant in our department or any other pertinent prospect. We wish you well in your venture to gain growth.”  </p> <p> However, we regret that your application DIDN’T make it to the next stage of this process. We’ve recognized your skills, knowledge and work experience and we hope to consider you for related future opportunities.

We have your contacts on the resume anare willing to engage you should any position become vacant in our department or any other pertinent prospect. We wish you well in your venture to gain growth.”  </p> <p> With an assumption that you didn’t have high hopes on getting that position, or it was just a ‘by-the-way, let me shoot at this opportunity,’ your next step before clicking the Sign Out button will determine whether or not you possess some soft skills in professional communication.

Of course, I’m talking about replying to that negative email-the one that didn’t arouse excitement in you! It’s common and more so normal to receive such kinds of responses when we apply for jobs. The answer will always be either a big Yes or No. Funny enough, the negation part is most of the time in bold!

Some of you are right now wondering, ‘why should I respond to an email from a company that has just denied me a job?’ Well, think about the following;</p>

<h3 style="color: red;"> 5 Invaluable Tips for Students Pursuing Careers in Music</h3></a>
 <div class="desc">
<p> A career in the music industry is both rewarding and daunting. <br />While music is such a universally appreciated art form, <br />successfully establishing a career in this field will require some prior-planning. <br />If you’re a college student and wish to pursue music professionally, <br /.there are a few things you can do to set yourself up for success. <br />Here are five essential tips:
     <a href="https://treliksglobb.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/5-invaluable-tips-for-students-pursuing-careers-in-music/"> Continue</a>
<h4>1. Learn the business side of music</h4>
In this day and age, a career in music is also a career in business. In a time when we’re expected to be self-sufficient in almost every aspect of our careers, knowing how to manage your finances, secure record deals, and organize tours will increase your likelihood of becoming successful.

If you’ve never taken a business course before, consider enrolling in a practical course that will educate you on how to manage taxes, make professional connections, and invest smartly. The best kinds of courses will also include co-op placements at a company related to the field you plan on pursuing. Forming professional connections are the best way to establish a career, so meeting the right people through a co-op placement will create significantly more opportunity.

<h4>2. Take a writing course</h4>
This course doesn’t need to be a songwriting course, although that may be very useful for a career in music if it’s offered at your college. Rather, enrolling in a writing course that will teach you how to communicate professionally with others will sharpen your overall skillset. The writing course should teach you how to write professional emails, letters, and contracts, all of which will be invaluable when you’re signing a record deal or hiring talent managers. Understanding how to communicate your ideas clearly is one of the most important skills for a professional in any field. </P>
